In Search of Light
===================

Yet another roguelike game written in pure Common Lisp.

Game is still under development and will be under it for a while (forever?)
because I'm not focused on making it complete. It's more like an experimental
project rather than an actual playable game.

Running
--------

Make sure you cd into project's dir. My code it bad, it can't handle other cases.

Controls
---------

   k
h     l  -- movement
   j

;  -- pick object
